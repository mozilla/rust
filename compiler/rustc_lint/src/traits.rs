    /// The `drop_bounds` lint checks for generics with `std::ops::Drop` as

    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// fn foo<T: Drop>() {}
    /// ```
    ///
    /// {{produces}}
    ///
    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// A generic trait bound of the form `T: Drop` is most likely misleading
    /// and not what the programmer intended (they probably should have used
    /// `std::mem::needs_drop` instead).
    ///
    /// `Drop` bounds do not actually indicate whether a type can be trivially
    /// dropped or not, because a composite type containing `Drop` types does
    /// not necessarily implement `Drop` itself. NaÃ¯vely, one might be tempted
    /// to write an implementation that assumes that a type can be trivially
    /// dropped while also supplying a specialization for `T: Drop` that
    /// actually calls the destructor. However, this breaks down e.g. when `T`
    /// is `String`, which does not implement `Drop` itself but contains a
    /// `Vec`, which does implement `Drop`, so assuming `T` can be trivially
    /// dropped would lead to a memory leak here.
    ///
    /// Furthermore, the `Drop` trait only contains one method, `Drop::drop`,
    /// which may not be called explicitly in user code (`E0040`), so there is
    /// really no use case for using `Drop` in trait bounds, save perhaps for
    /// some obscure corner cases, which can use `#[allow(drop_bounds)]`.
