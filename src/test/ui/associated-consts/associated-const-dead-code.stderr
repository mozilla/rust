   |     ^^^^^^---^^^^^^^^^^
   |           |
   |           help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_BAR`

   = note: the leading underscore signals that this associated constant serves some other purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect.
note: the lint level is defined here
