warning: variant is never constructed: `Void`

LL |     Void(Void),
   |     ----^^^^^^
   |     |
   |     help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Void`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore signals that this variant serves some other purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect.
   = note: `-W dead-code` implied by `-W unused`
