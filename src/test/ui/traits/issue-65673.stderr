error[E0277]: the size for values of type `(dyn Trait + 'static)` cannot be known at compilation time
  --> $DIR/issue-65673.rs:9:16

LL |     type Ctx;
   |     --------- required by this bound in `WithType::Ctx`
...
LL |     type Ctx = dyn Alias<T>;
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
   = note: associated types introduce an implicit `Sized` obligation
   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `(dyn Trait + 'static)`
help: consider relaxing the `Sized` obligation

LL |     type Ctx: ?Sized;
   |             ^^^^^^^^
