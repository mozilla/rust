error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*p4` as mutable, as it is behind a `*const` pointer
  --> $DIR/raw-ref-unsize-coercion-receiver.rs:18:20
   |
LL |   let p4 = &raw const a4;
   |            ------------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable pointer: `&mut raw const a4`
LL |   let _ = unsafe { p4.get_unchecked_mut(1) };
   |                    ^^ `p4` is a `*const` pointer, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
