warning: function is never used: `dead_function`

   |
LL | fn dead_function() {}
   |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_dead_function`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore signals that this function serves some other purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect.
