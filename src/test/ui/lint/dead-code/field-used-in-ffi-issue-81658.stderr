LL |     items: Option<Vec<T>>,
   |     -----^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |     |
   |     help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_items`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore signals that this field serves some other purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect. (e.g. for its effect when dropped or in foreign code)
note: the lint level is defined here
